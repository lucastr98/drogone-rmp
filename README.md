# DroGone Motion Planning RMP
This repository contains the implementation of the Bachelor Thesis "Motion Planning for DroGone using Riemannian Motion Policies". The following packages were newly implemented, the others were taken to a large extent from DroGone [1]:
* drogone_motion_planner
* drogone_dummy_detector
* drogone_transformation_lib
* drogone_msgs_rmp
This thesis was based on Riemannian Motion Policies, which are presented in [2]. An existing implementation of RMPs [3] was used where minor changes were made in a fork [4].
